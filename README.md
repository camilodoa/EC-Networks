# Networks

## Getting started with git

First, install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) so you can access it in your shell (alternatively you can use a git-helper application like [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)). If you have a Mac, I would recommend installing [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), and then running

```bash
brew install git
```

Homebrew takes care of your paths and is overall super convenient.

Then, navigate to the directory where you would like to place this project folder. Once you've done this, run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/camilodoa/EC-Networks.git
```

to copy the repo locally.

## To Do

- Research what has been done with Evolutionary Image Generation

- Research classical [GANS](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan)

- Look into frameworks for ML in Clojure / Porting ML into Clojure

- Look into using different discriminators

  - Results can inform what the classifiers are doing

- Read up on Neural Networks

- ~Set up GitHub accounts~

- Join [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/ec-networks/shared_invite/zt-d2zlhyvq-0nHuia~~UffdUTl8EGBUGg)

## Notes

Notes people take on research/frameworks should be put in the `/text` directory.

## Datasets

If you find cool image datasets, please feel free to put them in the `/datasets` directory!
