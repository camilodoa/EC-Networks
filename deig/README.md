Deep Evolutionary Image Generation.

## About

Deep Evolutionary Image Generation (DEIG) applies an evolutionary approach to the question of Computer-Generated Images. Over time, a population of images are evolved using a pre-trained discriminator network as the population's fitness function.

This directory is the root directory for the Evolutionary Algorithm. It imports the fitness function from `../discriminator/discriminator.py` and translates it into Clojure for use in EC.

## Getting Started

 If you have a Mac and you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, you can simply run:

 ```bash
 brew install clojure
 ```

to allow you to access the Clojure interpreter from the command line.
