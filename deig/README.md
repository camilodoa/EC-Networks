# deig

Deep Evolutionary Image Generation.

## About

Deep Evolutionary Image Generation (DEIG) applies an evolutionary approach to the question of Computer-Generated Images. Over time, a population of images are evolved using a pre-trained classifier network as the population's fitness function.


## Getting Started

 If you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, you can simply run:

 ```bash
 brew install clojure
 brew install leiningen
 ```

To get the Clojure interpreter from the command line.

To run our fitness function, you will also need python3/pip3. To download python3 and our dependencies, run:

```bash
brew install python3
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

To install our Clojure dependencies, run:

```bash
lein deps
```
